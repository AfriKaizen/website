The Khura Agency Team reached out to us with the following task:
Build the website to be mobile ready, with a fresh, modern & clean look.
Allow visitors to get all information about the podcast and have them be able to listen to the Podcast episodes from the website and also read related blog posts.


## What Did We Build? ‚öíÔ∏è

We got straight to work and settled on the following for our tech:
- 1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordpress - Content Management System</a>

We love working with Wordpress! We have been building beautiful websites with it for years and when we need to build a content heavy website this is our go to tool.
We used Wordpress also because our end users (Khura Agency Team) are exprienced bloggers who have been using Wordpress to publish blogging content.
We managed to bring in all the content for the website, blog posts and images and organise it in a new Wordpress deployment. We also setup
this new Wordpress website on its own dedicated <a class="text-blue-400" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">subdomain</a> 
off the main khuraagency.com website, deploying it @ kasts.khuraagency.com.


## Plugins üîå
- 1. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/breeze/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breeze ‚Äì WordPress Cache Plugin</a><br/>
One of the best cache plugin we have ever used. Manages your wordpress cache on different levels and makes your website faster.

- 2. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordfence Security</a><br/>
You always need security and this plugin continually monitors your website for vulnerabilities as well as blocks malicious IP's.

- 3. <a href="https://blubrry.com/services/powerpress-plugin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PowerPress Podcasting plugin by Blubrry</a><br/>
This is one of the most popular and feature-rich podcasting plugins for WordPress. It allows users to manage and publish multiple podcasts, generate iTunes-compliant RSS feeds, embed media players, and offers extensive SEO settings.

When choosing Wordpress plugins we always do our research and find the highest rated plugins with regular updates so that we do not introduce vulnerabilities
into our clients websites. We always use either plugins that we have used regularly in the past or plugins with well-known developers, this makes maintenance and updates easy and manageable.






## The Solution üéâ
The website can be accessed here: <a class="hover:text-blue-800 text-blue-600 pointer-mouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="http://kasts.khuraagency.com/">http://kasts.khuraagency.com/</a>

<p class="text-xs">In some cases we do not maintain our clients websites as some jobs are only to build and not maintain therefore we can not guarantee that the links we provide will always work.
We have taken screenshots at the time the work was done to show you what the final product looked like.</p>
