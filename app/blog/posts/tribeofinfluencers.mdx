Tribe of Influencers is a community platform focused on cultivating blog culture, nurturing networking, and sustaining mutual support among creators. 
They act as a hub where bloggers share their work, get exposure, and connect with like-minded creators. More information about them can be found on their

The team behind the collective reached out to us as they hold a yearly voting competition were different bloggers & influencers are awarded according to votes cast by their fans 
and the general public. They call these the Zim Blog Awards.

They wanted a new approach for thsi years competition were people would be able to cast votes using their social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter & Instagram) for different influencers & bloggers
but be restricted to voting once in each category per 24 hour period. At the end of the month-long voting period they would tally up the votes and announce the winners.
We helped did not only build them a brand new clean and minimalist website but also helped them by designing, building, launching and running the competition using the voting app we built.
They gave us a shout out when they announced the votes! 😃

With the following Task: Give the Website a fresh minimalist look and build a Voting App that allows the public to vote for their favourite Influencers & Bloggers using Facebook, Instagram & Twitter.
We set out to build a world class website and a world class voting app. 💪🏾

## What Did We Build? ⚒️

We got straight to work and settled on the following for our tech:
- 1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordpress - Tribe Of Influencers Main Website</a>

We love working with Wordpress! We built a very minimalist Wordpress website which made sure to put the content of what the Tribe does front and center.
We went for a very clean white look which focused on putting content front and cetner. This kept things simple and made sure that anyone visiting the website would be presented with
exactly what they are looking for, which is what the Tribe does and who they are. Clean. Minimal. Simple. This is what it looked like 👇🏾

- 2. <a href="https://angular.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Angular - Voting App Frontend</a>

We built the frontend for the voting app using Angular. We also used Tailwind CSS to style the app making sure to keep the voting app UI consistant with the Tribe of Influencers main
website. Keeping the large use of white spaces and adopting mild gray and a touch of blue and green here and there to break up monotony. This is what it looked like 👇🏾 <br/>

- 3. <a href="https://strapi.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Strapi - Voting App Headless Backend</a>

We used Strapi as the Backend for the Voting App. This is a Headless CMS meaning that its a content management system that does not come with a client facing interface but gives you 
and admin dashbaord where you can use different kinds of blocks and content types which can be served up via API calls to a frontend of your choice. It also provides great and
extensive Social Media login mechanisms which allows your frontend app to let users login via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter among other platforms.
