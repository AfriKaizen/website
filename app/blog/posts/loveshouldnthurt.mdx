Build the website to be mobile ready, with a fresh, modern look while remaining mobile friendly and usable. Allow different kinds of media that were part of the campgin such as
music videos and songs to be made availabel through the website.


## What Did We Build? ‚öíÔ∏è

We got straight to work and settled on the following for our tech:
- 1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordpress - Content Management System</a>

We love working with Wordpress! We have been building beautiful websites with it for years and when we need to build a content heavy website this is our go to tool.
We used it to build the website and picked it for its vast content management capabilities. We had to get creative around the design and used a lot of white space and big bold 
images to communicate the idea and get the viewer's focus to gravitate towards the main message: "Love Should't Hurt". So as not to make it monotonous and repetitive we broke up
different sections with testimonials, videos and songs places across the home page to get the viewer all the content available for the campaign and let the pick and choose what they
would love to consume.

## Plugins üîå
- 1. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/breeze/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breeze ‚Äì WordPress Cache Plugin</a><br/>
One of the best cache plugin we have ever used. Manages your wordpress cache on different levels and makes your website faster.

- 2. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordfence Security</a><br/>
You always need security and this plugin continually monitors your website for vulnerabilities as well as blocks malicious IP's.

- 3. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/embed-soundcloud-block/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Player For SoundCloud ‚Äì Embed and Play SoundCloud Tracks</a><br/>
We used this plugin as it provides an easy way to embed SoundCloud content into a wordpress site. We uploaded all the music onto SoundCloud and provided
the playlist on the home page and the visitors to the website could play the songs directly from the website.

- 4. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-embed/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Embeds for YouTube</a><br/>
This plugin made it easy to provide YouTube videos associated with the campaign on the website. We uploaded all the music videos to YouTube and linked them back to the home page
using this plugin.

When choosing Wordpress plugins we always do our research and find the highest rated plugins with regular updates so that we do not introduce vulnerabilities
into our clients websites. We always use either plugins that we have used regularly in the past or plugins with well-known developers, this makes maintenance and updates easy and manageable.






## The Solution üéâ
The website can be accessed here: <a class="hover:text-yellow-800 text-yellow-600 pointer-mouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://loveshouldnthurt.org.zw/">https://loveshouldnthurt.org.zw/</a>

<p class="text-xs">In some cases we do not maintain our clients websites as some jobs are only to build and not maintain therefore we can not guarantee that the links we provide will always work.
We have taken screenshots at the time the work was done to show you what the final product looked like.</p>
