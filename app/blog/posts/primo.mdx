Build a website which the client can use to advertise their brand and post different recipes that can be accessed by their customers.

## What Did We Build? ⚒️

We got straight to work and settled on the following for our tech:
- 1. Wordpress - Content Management System

We have been working with wordpress for over 10 years! With such vast experience in the tech going for this option was a no-brainer.
We used it to build the website and picked it because of its vast content management capabilities. The ease of customization as well
as the availability of many free and paid themese and plugins makes it an easy choice when you want to build a good looking, functional
website that can be extended and cater for multiple users logging in and updating content. We also added a few plugins for security &
to achieve the core feature of displaying and managing recipes.

## Plugins 🔌
- 1. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-recipe-maker/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">WP Recipe Maker</a><br/>
Upload and display recipes on any page. We mainly ended up displaying these on the blog page as different blog posts as this helped with SEO.

- 2. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/breeze/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breeze – WordPress Cache Plugin</a><br/>
One of the best cache plugin we have ever used. Manages your wordpress cache on different levels and makes your website faster.

- 3. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordfence Security</a><br/>
You always need security and this plugin continually monitors your website for vulnerabilities as well as blocks malicious IP's.
