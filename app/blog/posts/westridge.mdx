## What Was The Problem? ü§î

<a class="hover:text-blue-400 text-blue-300 decoration-blue-400 pointer-mouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westridge_High_School">Westridge</a>
Schools are located in the Belvedere suburb of Harare, <a class="hover:text-green-600 dark:hover:text-yellow-500 text-green-400 decoration-yellow-400 pointer-mouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">üáøüáº Zimbabwe.</a>
The schools emphasize "human values-based education" and multiculturalism, with a focus on character-building.

The Group of Schools needed a unified website that could show their Early Childhood Development (ECD), Primary & High Schools. This would involve building 3 distinct websites that would need to
be consolidated into a single entry point and be able to direct visitors to different websites (Primary, ECD & High School) as per need. 

For this project they worked with <a class="hover:text-red-600 dark:hover:text-red-500 text-red-400 decoration-red-400 pointer-mouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ogilvyzimbabwe/">Barkers Ogilvy Zimbabwe</a> 
who reached out to us with the following task:
Build the website to be responsive so it can be used on Mobile, Tablet & Desktop screens. Let school admins manage content and update the website through out the year with calendar events and school related content.

## What Did We Build? ‚öíÔ∏è

We got straight to work and settled on the following for our tech:
- 1. <a href="http://wordpress.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordpress - Content Management System</a>

We love working with Wordpress! We have been building beautiful websites with it for years and when we need to build a content heavy website this is our go to tool.
We settled on a multi-site wordpress deployment which basically enables the management of multiple websites from a single WordPress installation and dashboard. 
This allows for a network of interconnected sites that share the same core WordPress files, themes, and plugins, while maintaining separate content and media libraries for each individual site. 
We deployed 3 sites in this maner: 

- 1. ECD: https://westridgeschools.ac.zw/ecd/
- 2. Primary: https://westridgeschools.ac.zw/primary/
- 3. High School: https://westridgeschools.ac.zw/high/



## Plugins üîå
- 1. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/breeze/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Breeze ‚Äì WordPress Cache Plugin</a><br/>
One of the best cache plugin we have ever used. Manages your wordpress cache on different levels and makes your website faster.

- 2. <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Wordfence Security</a><br/>
You always need security and this plugin continually monitors your website for vulnerabilities as well as blocks malicious IP's.

- 3. <a href="https://theeventscalendar.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Events Calendar</a><br/>
Allowed us to create different kinds of school events and publish them, giving times, locations, atendees and allowing students and parents to RSVP for them.

When choosing Wordpress plugins we always do our research and find the highest rated plugins with regular updates so that we do not introduce vulnerabilities
into our clients websites. We always use either plugins that we have used regularly in the past or plugins with well-known developers, this makes maintenance and updates easy and manageable.






## The Solution üéâ
The Main Landing Page can be accessed here: <a class="hover:text-blue-800 text-blue-600 pointer-mouse" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://westridgeschools.ac.zw/">https://westridgeschools.ac.zw/</a>

<p class="text-xs">In some cases we do not maintain our clients websites as some jobs are only to build and not maintain therefore we can not guarantee that the links we provide will always work.
We have taken screenshots at the time the work was done to show you what the final product looked like.</p>
